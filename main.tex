Beast: the audacious musings of an aspiring software craftsman


Never publish major releases with TODO tags in code
Never publish minor releases with FIXME tags in code

Write Javadocs incrementally, while maintaining a FIXME tag in each incomplete document until finished. 
Thus software will not be released with incomplete javadocs.

\section{The art of Storytelling}
Writing good software is more akin to authoring the most engaging literary prose. Every aspect of the end products should be sharing an experience with the user.
documentation surround an object's interface is more like a legend.  It's what the clients think about the object, and it all they care about.  What the object does in it's contruction and implementation, is what the object says about it self.  But know one cares about what you say about yourself, because it maybe smoking mirrors.  Thus the legend if validated through an array of testing
PRACTICALS
Java doc header should start with a small explanation of the chosen name for the class.  Then examples of what clients might experience with said class.Following each example with a small demonstration of how that experience may play out.
